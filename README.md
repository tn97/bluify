This application was built to serve as a web-player for spotify. At the time of creation, spotify's API required all of the sound manipulation - including music playback - to go through spotify's API calls. As of that day, the music tool has been in beta, having lacked many functionalities to creating a decent web-player. 

-Some functions that are not available yet include volume manipulation, and constant music playback.

A premium account is **not** required to use this application, as Spotify allows for any user with an account to access a program using their api. Though if a spotify account is not owned, a guest account has been given on the home page of the application.

If you wish to download this app and use it locally, all you have to do after downloading it is to either use yarn install or npm install and then use the yarn start or npm start command in the console. Instructions follow below.

### A demo of the deployed application can be found [here](https://bluify.herokuapp.com/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
